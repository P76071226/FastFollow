# FastFollow
## Overview

**FastFollow** is a proof-of-concept chat interface that makes conversations **faster and more exploratory**:

- When you ask a question, the system generates:
  - âœ… A clear main answer
  - âœ… A few **follow-up questions** (shown as clickable buttons)
  - âœ… Pre-computed answers to those follow-ups (cached in memory)

- When you click a follow-up button:
  - âš¡ The cached answer is displayed **immediately**
  - ðŸ”„ The system computes the **next layer** of follow-ups in the background
  - ðŸŽ¯ You can keep digging deeper with instant responses

The design is inspired by real user needs: keep the UX **chat-like**, but remove the frustrating wait for obvious follow-up queries.
